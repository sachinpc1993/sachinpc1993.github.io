I am a **Researcher** with expertise in **Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Conversational AI**.  

I have **3+ years of experience as a consulting Data Scientist**, applying **IR, NLP, and Generative AI** to enterprise-scale conversational platforms, and **3+ years as a Software Engineer**. This combination of research and industry experience shapes how I approach problems—grounding solutions in **scientific rigor** while ensuring **practical impact**.
 
I completed my **PhD in Computer Science at RMIT University (2025)**, where my research focused on developing and evaluating methods for the **fair dissemination of multiple perspectives in intelligent question answering systems**. My academic journey also includes a **Master’s in Information Technology** from Monash University, Melbourne, with a specialization in **advanced machine learning** and **data-driven applications**, and a **Bachelor’s in Computer Science** from Amrita University, India.  

### Core Areas of Expertise
- Evaluation of information access systems.  
- Knowledge-augmented Conversational AI and its applications. 

At the foundation of my approach, I’m a **divergent thinker** who sees problems as puzzles to explore from every angle. By weaving together my experiences as a researcher, data scientist, and software engineer, I bring multiple perspectives to every project - turning ideas into impactful deliverables.
