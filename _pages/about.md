I am a **Researcher** specializing in **Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Conversational AI**. I earned my **PhD in Computer Science at RMIT University (2025)**, where I focused on developing and evaluating methods for the **fair dissemination of multiple perspectives in intelligent question answering systems**.  

My academic journey also includes a **Master’s in Information Technology** from Monash University, specializing in **advanced machine learning** and **data-driven applications**, and a **Bachelor’s in Computer Science** from Amrita University, India.

I bring **3+ years of experience as a consulting Data Scientist**, applying **IR, NLP, and Generative AI** to enterprise-scale conversational platforms, along with **3+ years as a Software Engineer**. This blend of research and industry practice shapes my approach—grounding solutions in **scientific rigor** while ensuring **real-world impact**.  
 
### Areas of Interest
- Evaluation of information access systems.  
- Knowledge-augmented Conversational AI and its applications. 

At my core, I’m a **divergent thinker** who enjoys seeing problems as puzzles to explore from different angles. By drawing on my experiences as a researcher, data scientist, and software engineer, I bring fresh perspectives to turn ideas into meaningful results. 

If you’re curious about what I’m building or are interested in collaborating, let’s connect.
